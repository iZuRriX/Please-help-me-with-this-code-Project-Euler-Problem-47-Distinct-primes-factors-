# Please-help-me-with-this-code-Project-Euler-Problem-47-Distinct-primes-factors-

I need someone to explain to me how this code works. 
My friends did it for me, but I don't understand it and it is really urgent. 
Thank you in advance. 
The problem goes: How do I find 4 sequential 4-digit numbers that contain 4 prime number multiples (that make up the 4-digit number when multiplied, the multiples don't have to be the same) in Visual Basic?
